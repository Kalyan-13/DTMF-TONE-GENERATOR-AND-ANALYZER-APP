# DTMF-TONE-GENERATOR-AND-ANALYZER-APP

Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling is a standard in telecommunication systems. This is a standard where keystrokes from the telephone keypad are
translated into dual tone signals over the audio link. It has been gaining popularity for some years now because of its numerous advantages over the traditional telephone
signaling scheme.

The main advantage of Goertzel algorithm is it reduces the complexity in the coefficient computation. DTMF detection is used to detect DTMF signals in presence of speech and dialing tone pulses.Besides being used to set up regular calls on a telephone line, DTMF detection is used for computer applications such as in voice mail, electronic mail and Telephone banking.
